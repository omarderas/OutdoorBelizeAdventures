          <h1>About Belize Outdoor Adventures</h1>
          <p>José Hernandez began his journey as a tour guide at the renowned Ian Anderson’s Caves Branch, where he developed his skills and gained valuable experience in outdoor adventure. Over the years, he worked as a freelance guide with respected companies like Hamanasi, Jaguar Paw, Chukka, and Caves Branch Outpost. Through these opportunities, José became highly knowledgeable in the many outdoor activities that make Belize unique.
             Today, José operates his own tour company, where his passion for guiding and sharing Belize’s natural wonders continues. When you join his tours, you’ll have the rare privilege of being guided by the owner himself, someone who truly knows and loves every corner of The Great Belize Outdoors.</p>
